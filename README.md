This project is about something like a furniture store. It will consist of several sections. 
- Navbar:  kind of complex one. At the top left corner, we have social media icons with nice hover effects. Then if you click on 'Sign up, login' Model Box will be displayed with registration, and with logging forms. 
- Next we have here navigation items with again, nice hover effects. And the first one has a drop down menu. Navbar is followed by slide show. As you see, it's working automatically. And also, we can manage it using those controls. 
- Next, we have here section which consists of two images. It's followed by another one. This section includes six cards. And those cards are displaying something like best selling furniture with some descriptions. 
- This section is followed by gallery. You see here nicely aligned images with some glory effect. And when we hover an image then it becomes more visible. And lastly, we have here simple form and photo. The most part of our project layout is created using CSS grid, but besides that we will use Flexbox for a couple of times. Also, throughout this project, you will meet some advanced CSS tricks and techniques. 
- Of course, project will be responsive on different screen sizes.
